<?php

/* EXERCISE 1

Create a Utility class.
This class will be used to display a Log message like this one : '2021-04-26 14:00:03 - Accessing file';
Create a Log() static method in the class to match the instructions.
Everytime this method is called, you will append message in a .log file (dont overwrite it).
You should be able to call this method anytime, without instanciating the class.
Create a client.php. Each time you're going to open 'client.php', it should save log in the file.
